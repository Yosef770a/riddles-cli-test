This project is a riddles game using the CLI. Each time the user is presented with one question until it is answered correctly, the type of questions can be a free question or a choice from a list.

A "challenge" in the askRiddle function in utils was to correctly handle 2 types of questions: free answer or multiple choice, displaying the list of answers and checking whether they are correct (since the key correctAnswer contains the position of the element in the string, a type conversion had to be done here as well).
